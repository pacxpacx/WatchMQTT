Simple watch and phone apps for receiving MQTT messages over a WebSocket connection.

Both apps now send proper MQTT `CONNECT` and `SUBSCRIBE` packets after the socket is opened so brokers will forward messages correctly. The watch UI lets you specify a WebSocket path (default `/ws`) when connecting. The apps automatically prefix the path with `/` if needed and the watch app waits for the broker's `CONNACK` before reporting that it is connected. WebSocket connections use the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mqtt` header so brokers requiring the MQTT subprotocol will accept the handshake. A tiny UDP datagram is also sent on launch to trigger the system's local network permission prompt.
